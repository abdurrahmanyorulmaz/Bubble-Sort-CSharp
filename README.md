# bubblesort.cs
This repository contains a bubblesort algorithm encoded in the C# language. 

This algorithm has several advantages. It is simple to write, easy to understand, and only takes a few lines of code. The data is organized in place so there is little memory overhead, and once sorted, the data is in memory, ready for processing. The biggest drawback is that sorting takes time. The average duration increases as the number of table elements increases, almost exponentially. It takes almost a hundred times the number of items to rank ten times.
